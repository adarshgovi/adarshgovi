### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adarsh, a fourth-year Engineering Physics student at UBC. I am currently working with the [UBC Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) on Real-Time Systems research and with the [Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/) on applying diffusion models to human motion and interactions. I'm currently looking for Summer 2024 Internships!
